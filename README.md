# labview-ask-fsk-psk-simulation
This project demonstrates the implementation of ASK (Amplitude Shift Keying), FSK (Frequency Shift Keying), and PSK (Phase Shift Keying) modulation and demodulation in LabVIEW. It includes both 1 bit per symbol and 2 bits per symbol configurations to showcase different encoding schemes.
