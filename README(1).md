# QAM Simulator 1.0
> QAM Simulator 1.0 is a Python-based tool for visualizing Quadrature Amplitude Modulation (QAM) constellation diagrams with advanced features like noise addition, SNR and BNR calculations, and symbol phase analysis. It generates visualizations and data tables for various QAM sizes, making it ideal for telecommunications research, education, and signal analysis.

## Features

- Flexible QAM Size Support: Generate constellations for QAM sizes ranging from 4 to 4096.
- Noise Simulation: Add amplitude or phase noise with customizable intensity.
- Performance Metrics: Calculate and evaluate Signal-to-Noise Ratio (SNR) and Bit-to-Noise Ratio (BNR).
- Visual & Tabular Outputs:
   + Constellation diagrams annotated with symbol indices and optional noise/exclusion points.
   + Symbol energy and phase data exported as organized tables.
- Automated Export: Save results as PDF files directly to your desktop for easy access.

## Technologies Used

- NumPy: Efficient numerical operations.
- Matplotlib: High-quality data visualization.
- OS Module: Desktop file handling.

## How to Use

1. Run the Script: Input a valid QAM size (e.g., 16, 64, 256).
2. Choose Noise Options:
        - Decide whether to add noise.
        - Specify the noise type (amplitude/phase) and intensity.
3. View Outputs:
        - Constellation diagram PDF.
        - Symbol table PDF.
4. Evaluate Metrics:
        - Review SNR and BNR values in the terminal output.
